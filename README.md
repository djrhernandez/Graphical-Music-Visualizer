# Graphical-Music-Visualizer in C++ using OpenGL
## Introduction
An graphic rendering of a 3D Graphical Spectrum Analyzer that will give a run-time animation of a given input audio file by performing **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** on the audio samples. This project is implemented in C++ using OpenGL, and developed and tested on **Linux (ubuntu)** using the X11 Window system. The project was initially constructed to focus on the rendering techniques of OpenGL such as, real-time animation, lighting, shadows, reflections, and so on. 

## Frameworks / APIs used
The following c++ frameworks are used in this project.
 1. OpenGL
 2. X11 Windows
 3. Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)
